The summary statistics presented here can be used to calculate DM with a combined reference population from the datasets used in the article by [Cohen et al, 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0122541). All variables are in SI units and are transformed as needed to approach a normal distribution. See [Variables_units_and_transformations.xlsx](https://github.com/cohenaginglab/DM/blob/de040a3a33291adf43a23425644a31f70c307ad4/Variables_units_and_transformations.xlsx) for details.
