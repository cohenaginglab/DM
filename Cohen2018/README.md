The summary statistics provided here can be used to calculate DM with a combined reference population drawn from datasets used in the article by [Cohen et al, 2018](https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/73/2/175/4004806). System-specific DM can be calculated by selecting the corresponding subset of variables. All variables are in SI units and are transformed as needed to approach a normal distribution. See [Variables_units_and_transformations.xlsx](https://github.com/cohenaginglab/DM/blob/de040a3a33291adf43a23425644a31f70c307ad4/Variables_units_and_transformations.xlsx) for details.
