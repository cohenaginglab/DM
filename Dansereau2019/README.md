The summary statistics provided here can be used to calculate DM with a combined reference population from datasets used in the article by [Dansereau et al, 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12925). Two DM versions are available: "Set 1", which is comprised of 24 variables, and "Set 2", which is comprised of 12 variables. All variables are in SI units and are transformed as needed to approach a normal distribution. See [Variables_units_and_transformations.xlsx](https://github.com/cohenaginglab/DM/blob/de040a3a33291adf43a23425644a31f70c307ad4/Variables_units_and_transformations.xlsx) for details.
