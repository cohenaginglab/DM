The summary statistics presented here can be used to calculate DM with a combined reference population drawn from datasets used in the article by [Li et al, 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12402). System-specific DM can be calculated by selecting the corresponding subset of variables. All variables are in SI units and are transformed as needed to approach a normal distribution. See [Variables_units_and_transformations.xlsx](https://github.com/cohenaginglab/DM/blob/de040a3a33291adf43a23425644a31f70c307ad4/Variables_units_and_transformations.xlsx) for details.
