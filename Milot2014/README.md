The summary statistics provided here can be used to calculate DM with a combined reference population drawn from datasets used in the article by [Milot et al, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047637414000682?via%3Dihub). Two DM versions were calculated in this study: a "biological" suite and a "statistical" suite. All variables are in SI units and are transformed as needed to approach a normal distribution. See [Variables_units_and_transformations.xlsx](https://github.com/cohenaginglab/DM/blob/de040a3a33291adf43a23425644a31f70c307ad4/Variables_units_and_transformations.xlsx) for details.
